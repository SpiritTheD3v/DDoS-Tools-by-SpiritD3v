Hello. This is some information about the DDoS tool.

Credit to Dev7Knight for the website DDoS script.

1st thing, is how to set it up.

1. Run Installer.py.
2. Wait for modules to install.
3. Have fun! Open either the DDoS_Website.py or the DDoS_IP.py and DDoS whatever you want!

2nd thing you need to know, is that with the DDoS tool, you have to input the URL/IP, and the amount of threads to run.
With the amount of threads to run, you dont want too high or too low.
Depending on your PC, you can run different amounts of threads. For example, for me, I could run 1000, with an 8gb RAM laptop. It may cause lag.

I reccomend using a VPN for DDoSing, I use Windscribe.

I am not sure whether or not the IP DDoS works, but you'll have to find out for yourself.

Thats it for now.
Thanks for using my DDoS tool!
